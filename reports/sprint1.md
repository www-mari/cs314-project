## Planned Epics

Epic 1: Team Identification
We will add our team number and name to the application.
In this epic we plan to change the base code of the application to include our team name. We will
be changing the client side to display our team name to the user. We will also change the server
side to send our team name to the client. 

Epic 2: About
We will update the application to show information about our team.
In this epic we plan to update the client side application to display an image and information 
about our team as a whole. We also plan to include an image and a biography for each member of our team. 

Epic 3: Trip
We will add trip details for the user.
In this epic we plan to add functionality for the user to be able to click on places on the map.
This will construct a list of recent places the user has clicked. We plan to add the ability for 
the user to clear this list or individual items from the list.

## Retrospective

#### Things that went well
We completed everything that we planned to complete for this Sprint. We met as a team each day for a Scrum meeting. Our communcation was on point and we reached out to each other whenever we got stuck and worked it out as a team. 

#### Things that we need to improve
Next time we will try to complete more epics during the next Sprint. We also need to improve on handling bug tracking and resolution, especially with Apple products on our application. 

#### One thing we will change next time
Next time we will try to spread out our work more evenly across the days of the Sprint, and maybe we will be able to complete more epics this way. We will also try to have our final working release finished a full day before the due date.
