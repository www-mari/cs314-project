# Preferences for Sarah Walz

1. __Is it generally easier to reach you by text, electronic mail, voice mail or something else?  What hours?__ 
   * Text is the easist, but slack and teams I am also pretty reachable. I am mostly avalible from 9am to 11am and then again from 2pm to 6pm most days. 
1. __What are your expectations about what your team will accomplish this semester?__ 
   * I want to do a good job on the project and also learn the class content. As well as get closer as a team. 
1. __What are your personal goals for improving your teamwork and communication skills this semester?__ 
   * I want to get better at communicating and evenly sharing responsibilities with the team. 
1. __What kinds of obstacles might you encounter in trying to reach both your team and personal goals?__ 
   * Just figuring out how to work toghether as a team, getting to know each others habits and working around those and with each other. 
1. __What happens if some people on the team want to get an “A” while others think a “B” will be acceptable?__ 
   * We would talk about our expectations and then see if we can come to a consensus. At the same time if only one wants that A, if they put in the work, we can report that on the surveys and it sounds like Dave will give them the points they want.  
1. __Is it acceptable for some team members to do more work on the assignment in order to get an “A”?__ 
   * Yeah, if they want to. Personally, I also want an A, so I would love it if we all aimed for it. But I am also happy to put more work into it. 
1. __How much time per week do you anticipate it will take to make the project successful?__ 
   * Defintitly feels hard to judge right now. I would guess 10 hours ish. It will most likley depend on the week/sprint. 
1. __How will you decide who should do what on the project and activities?__ 
   * Play towards our strengths as well as towards our intrests. If people cant decide random or rock, paper, scissors. 
1. __What will happen if someone doesn’t follow through on a commitment (missing deadline, no show, etc.)?__ 
   * Ask them why it happened, exussable cirustances totally understandable if they talk with Dave. If they forget one time, hopefully can make it up somehow. If requiring pattern talk with Dave/report it. 
1. __What happens if people have different opinions on the quality of the work?__ 
   * Talk it out, see where people are coming from. Try to form a consesnsus, Definiton of Done. 
1. __How will you deal with different work habits of team members?__ 
   * Try to get used to and understand them, and then work around them. 
1. __Do you want to have a standing meeting time outside of class?__ 
   * Yes, I think it would help to reguaraly check in and ask any questions we have and report on what we have done and see what still needs to be done. 
1. __How often do you think the team will need to meet outside of class?__ 
   * Again, I feel like this is hard to judge without knowing more details of the project. Maybe one/twice a week. Maybe more frequently, especilly as we approach deadlines. 
1. __Will you need approval of every team member before making a decision?__ 
   * Depends on how big the descision is and how it will affect us. Like if need to pick the color of the button, whoever is programming it can decide. However, if it would affect the rest of the team or our grade, yes discuss it first. 
1. __What will you do if every team member except one agrees on something?__ 
   * Try to see where they are coming from and look if a consensus can be formed. If not, go by majority of votes. 
1. __What will you do if one person seems to be dominating the team process?__ 
   * If dominating like trying to control everything or do all the work themselves. I would bring it up to them. Maybe first privately and see their reaction and if anything changes. Then bring it up in a group and if that doesn't work bring in Dave. 
1. __What will you do if you feel most of the facilitation responsibilities are falling on you?__ 
   * Bring it up to the group and ask if someone can do this and this part next time.
