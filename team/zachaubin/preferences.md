# Preferences for Zach Aubin

1. __Is it generally easier to reach you by text, electronic mail, voice mail or something else?  What hours?__ 
   * MS Teams (sends notification to my phone), text, Slack, email. Hours vary, 9am-7pm is usually best.
1. __What are your expectations about what your team will accomplish this semester?__ 
   * Learn together about the tech/stack, learn to work together, learn to overcome challenges and setbacks together, produce a working product, get good grades.
1. __What are your personal goals for improving your teamwork and communication skills this semester?__ 
   * Improve my ability to compartmentalize and manage stress. Develop skills to help improve efficacy of remote meetings.
1. __What kinds of obstacles might you encounter in trying to reach both your team and personal goals?__ 
   * Me: Issues with living situation, trying to find a job. Team-level: Miscommunication, or someone drops off the map for 4+ days.
1. __What happens if some people on the team want to get an “A” while others think a “B” will be acceptable?__ 
   * Compromise, hopefully. Setting the bar for failure as anything less than perfect is a recipe for disaster, but we can choose to put in extra work if the team decides.
1. __Is it acceptable for some team members to do more work on the assignment in order to get an “A”?__ 
   * From what I've heard BossDave say, generally no if it makes an extreme imbalance. There should be some wiggle-room though, if the team has consensus.
1. __How much time per week do you anticipate it will take to make the project successful?__ 
   * 3hrs lecture, 1hr+ lecture-prep assignments, 6hrs+ individual/group project contributions. 
1. __How will you decide who should do what on the project and activities?__ 
   * Talk it over as a team, take dibs with approvals. Everyone should get a chance to learn.
1. __What will happen if someone doesn’t follow through on a commitment (missing deadline, no show, etc.)?__ 
   * Someone should reach out to make sure they're okay. Active members choose who will reach out. Past that, we should call a team meeting. 
1. __What happens if people have different opinions on the quality of the work?__ 
   * Each person with a differing view should make their case. If all members cannot be brought to consensus or comprimise we should look for the third option. At worst, vote. 
1. __How will you deal with different work habits of team members?__ 
   * As long as deadlines and requirements are met, I have no issues with different working habits or styles.
1. __Do you want to have a standing meeting time outside of class?__ 
   * Right now it doesn't seem like we need to, but I'm pretty sure this will be a good idea at some point.
1. __How often do you think the team will need to meet outside of class?__ 
   * 1-2 times per week should do it. If less/more works better, we do that.
1. __Will you need approval of every team member before making a decision?__ 
   * No, that will slow things down. Small decisions work with one approval, larger decisions can be brought to the team. If we set up modular tasks, that's fine too.
1. __What will you do if every team member except one agrees on something?__ 
   * Find out why we disagree. No one should feel pushed out. Try to incorporate the views somehow so that everyone is included.
1. __What will you do if one person seems to be dominating the team process?__ 
   * First make sure it's not me doing it. Then, someone can create a task and ask the current domineer if [member_x] can take lead on it. Sometimes it does help when someone takes lead momentarily.
1. __What will you do if you feel most of the facilitation responsibilities are falling on you?__ 
   * Facilitate some of the facilitation responsibilities, delegate to equal load.
