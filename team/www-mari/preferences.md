# Preferences for Mari Dudek

1. __Is it generally easier to reach you by text, electronic mail, voice mail or something else?  What hours?__ 
   * Text at any time. Teams or Slack everyday early afternoon through late evening.
1. __What are your expectations about what your team will accomplish this semester?__ 
   * I expect to develop a good relationship with the team and do really well on the course project.
1. __What are your personal goals for improving your teamwork and communication skills this semester?__ 
   * My goal is to get assignments done early & efficiently, and also work on time management and group communication skills as multiple of my classes involve teamwork and group projects.
1. __What kinds of obstacles might you encounter in trying to reach both your team and personal goals?__ 
   * An obstacle I will face is juggling my schedule this semester and managing my stress. 
1. __What happens if some people on the team want to get an “A” while others think a “B” will be acceptable?__ 
   * Teamwork is all about communication and compromise. Hopefully something like that doesn’t cause arguments or tension within the group and we can work it out. 
1. __Is it acceptable for some team members to do more work on the assignment in order to get an “A”?__ 
   * I believe so. It shouldn’t be a situation where someone does way more work than someone else. But if a team member wants to put a little extra effort in, this is why Dave grades on an individual basis.
1. __How much time per week do you anticipate it will take to make the project successful?__ 
   * Maybe 7-8 hours. That’s purely a guess since we haven’t even gotten started on the project.
1. __How will you decide who should do what on the project and activities?__ 
   * We will probably decide based on what people want to do and where strengths lie within our team.
1. __What will happen if someone doesn’t follow through on a commitment (missing deadline, no show, etc.)?__ 
   * Mistakes happen sometimes but if it’s a pattern then we need to speak with Dave and probably end up giving them a bad review at the end of the semester.
1. __What happens if people have different opinions on the quality of the work?__ 
   * This should probably be something we talk about as a team beforehand for each step of the project so that it doesn’t become a problem near the deadline. If there is differing opinion, we talk it out and explain our sides.
1. __How will you deal with different work habits of team members?__ 
   * Different work habits isn’t always a bad thing. We need to learn to work together, but if it becomes a problem we need to compromise and learn how to work in a way that sets each other up in the best way to succeed.
1. __Do you want to have a standing meeting time outside of class?__ 
   * Yes.
1. __How often do you think the team will need to meet outside of class?__ 
   * At least once a week, probably twice
1. __Will you need approval of every team member before making a decision?__ 
   * Small decisions in pieces of our own assignments probably don’t need discussions, but big decisions that would affect everybody absolutely.
1. __What will you do if every team member except one agrees on something?__ 
   * Communicate and compromise.
1. __What will you do if one person seems to be dominating the team process?__ 
   * Discuss as a group and hope they understand that everyone’s opinion is important in the group. If things do not change, maybe it is something that needs to be brought up with Dave.
1. __What will you do if you feel most of the facilitation responsibilities are falling on you?__ 
   * Have an open discussion with the team, bring Dave into the discussion if necessary.
